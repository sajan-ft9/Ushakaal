Ushakaal, which means Dawn in Nepali, is an ecommerce platform designed to empower Nepalese women by providing them with a space to sell homemade products. The project is built on core PHP with OOP principles and has three roles: Admin, Users, and Delivery personnel.

Admin can create notices about various programs that can help women, including awareness, training, and events. Users can register and login to the platform using their system or Google accounts. They can buy products, add them to their cart or wishlist, rate products, and pay using cash on delivery or an integrated payment system called esewa.

Users also have their own exclusive admin panel where they can create and sell products, with sales tracked and revenue and status information provided in charts. Additionally, users can share their thoughts and ideas in a blog that can be viewed by anyone. Delivery personnel can log in to update the status of deliveries and check cash on delivery.

The Ushakaal project leverages PHP, MySQL, JS, HTML, and CSS to create a user-friendly web platform that empowers Nepalese women by helping them sell and buy products, while also sharing thoughts and getting news about different programs through the admin.
